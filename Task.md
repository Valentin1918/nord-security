# Interview task "Password Health"

## Tasks

 Our customer support team is receiving a storm of complaints. You're the only guy who can solve this problem. Here's what you have to do to fix the situation:

* You may notice that the logout button is not working
* Create an additional tab (old) that should show passwords older than 30d
* Login validation message is non-human-readable. UX can be improved a bit too
* Add a loader to the login page
* Make sure that the page is not reloaded, after the password update
* Add tests
* Refactor the code (this will keep your teammates happy)
  * Code should be clean and consistent
  * Basic programming principles should be followed, like 
    [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), 
    [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), 
    [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns),
    etc.
* Find at least one security issue
  * Hint1: You might want to look in login / logout functionality
  * Hint2: Feel free to change "backend" code too
* Fix as many errors as you notice
